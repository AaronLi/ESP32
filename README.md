# DroneBridge for ESP32
DroneBridge enabled firmware for the popular ESP32 modules from Espressif Systems. Probably the cheapest way to communicate with your drone.

## Features
 - Bi-directional link: **MAVLink, MSP & LTM**
 - Very low price: **~7â‚¬**
 - Up to **150m** range
 - **Weight: <10 g**
 - Supported by: **DroneBridge for Android (app), mwptools, QGroundControl, impload etc.**
 - **Easy to set up**: Power connection + UART connection to flight controller
 - **Fully configurable through easy to use web interface**
 - **Parsing of LTM & MSPv2** for more reliable connection and less packet loss
 - **Fully transparent telemetry downlink option** for continuous streams like MAVLink or and other protocol
 - Reliable, low latency, light weight
 - Upload mission etc.

Tested with: DOIT ESP32 module

 ## Setup
 ### Flashing the firmware using the precompiled binarys
 -- TODO
### Wiring
 -- TODO

Connect UART of ESP32 to a 3.3V UART of your flight controller. Set the flight controller port to the desired protocol. (Power the ESP32 module with a stable 5-12V power source) **Check out manufacturer datasheet! Only some modules can take more than 3.3V/5V on VIN PIN**

### Configuration
 1. Connect to the wifi `DroneBridge ESP32` with password `dronebridge`
 2. In your browser type: `dronebridge.local` (Chrome: `http://dronebridge.local`) or `192.168.2.1` into the address bar. 
 **You might need to disable the cellular connection to force the browser to use the wifi connection**
 3. Configure as you please and hit `save`

**Configuration Options:**
 - **`Wifi password`: Up to 64 character long
 - **`UART baud rate`: Same as you configured on your flight controller
 - **`GPIO TX PIN Number` & `GPIO RX PIN Number`: The pins you want to use for TX & RX (UART). See pin out of manufacturer of your ESP32 device **Flight controller UART must be 3.3V or use an inverter.**
 - `UART serial protocol`: MultiWii based or MAVLink based - configures the parser
 - `Transparent packet size`: Only used with 'serial protocol' set to transparent. Length of UDP packets
 - `LTM frames per packet`: Buffer the specified number of packets and send them at once in one packet

** Require restart/reset of ESP32 module

## Use with DroneBridge for Android or QGroundControl
![DroneBridge for Android app screenshot](https://github.com/DroneBridge/ESP32/blob/master/wiki/dp_app-map-2017-10-29-kleiner.png)

 - Use the Android app to display live telemetry data. Mission planning capabilities for MAVLink will follow.
 - Connect via TCP to the ESP32 to send & receive data with a GCS of your choice

## Compile yourself (developers)

 You will need the Espressif SDK: esp-idf + toolchain. Check out their website for more info and on how to set it up.
 The code is written in pure C using the esp-idf (no arduino libs). **This project uses the v4.0 branch of ESP-IDF**

 Compile and flash by running: `make`, `make flash`
